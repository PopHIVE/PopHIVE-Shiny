## Overview

Enclosed is the code for an interim first PopHIVE prototype dashboard, version 1b. It was created as a stop-gap solution because the original version experienced crashes when accessed by too many users, and the JavaScript-based second prototype had not yet been released. You can find the code for the second prototype here: [PopHIVE/PopHIVE-Prototype](https://github.com/PopHIVE/PopHIVE-Prototype/tree/main). This version was not formally developed and contains many of the same features and content as the original version 1b, which can be found here: [PopHIVE/DSDE-PopHIVE](https://github.com/PopHIVE/DSDE-PopHIVE).

The was originally developed in a [YSPH Data Science and Data Equity](https://github.com/ysph-dsde) (YSPH-DSDE) GitHub Organization repository and was copied into the [PopHIVE](https://github.com/PopHIVE) GitHub Organization Aug 12th, 2025. At the time of transfer, the YSPH-DSDE GitHub Organization codebase was no longer being actively contributed to and had been archived.

This is a copy of the dashboard (v. 1b) that was developed by Professor Weinberger and can be found [here](https://weinbergerlab.shinyapps.io/pophive_test/).

**Dates active:** April 11th â€“ May 9th, 2025
